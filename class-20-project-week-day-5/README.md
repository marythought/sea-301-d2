## Grading

### Requirements

Team

* Three or four students per team
* Each member makes meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.
* Web Application

Single-page application

* All pages use "bookmark-able" client-side routes in the URL.
* Has at least three interlinked pages.
* Has clear navigation between the pages.
* At least two pages accept and process user input.
* Excluding jQuery and pages.js, uses at least two 3rd party libraries.
* Is deployed live on the Internet. Suggestions: heroku, surge.sh, or your own web host
* Application state persists between page loads.
* Uses AJAX to load dynamic data, caches the data locally, and uses a cache-validation scheme on page reload.
* Avoids race condition bugs by using appropriate callback design. Alternatives to chained callbacks are synchronization mechanisms (see extra credit item, next).
* Include a short video clip (10 to 20 seconds in duration) that contains audio and video content. The video introduces your team or is related to your web app. Video playback controls must be enabled. Incorporate video using one of the following options:
- For video you found online, use the `<video>` element.
- For video that you created and uploaded to a 3rd party video server such as YouTube, use `<iframe>`, then in your Canvas submission for this assignment, describe how your created and uploaded the video.
- Animate your own video or animation inside `<canvas>`.

Extra Credit

* [+5 pts.] Uses jQuery deferred objects or Javascript Promises to avoid race conditions related to async events such as page load, client-side routing, AJAX responses, user input events, and timers.
* [+2 pts]: Use Javascript to show/hide closed captions in the video, and describe in your comments the difference between closed captions and subtitles.

Your grade is based on your individual results [60 pts] and your project's technical merit [35 pts] and team's final presentation [5 pts].

Your individual grade depends on the following criteria.

* [42 pts] Javascript contributions
* [5 pts] HTML code
* [5 pts] CSS code
* [2 pts extra credit] for each of the following items:
	* CSS keyframe animations
	* SVG graphics manipulation using Javascript or CSS
	* Third party animation libraries such as jQuery mobile or velocity.js
* [8 pts] Answers to questions/instructions in this assignment. Submit links to commits and pull requests that demonstrate your contributions. Activities tracked by the links must show that you committed work every day of the week. Describe each link in terms of the tasks you accomplished.

Individual effort is graded based on **links to commits and Pull Requests** that demonstrate your contributions.

Technical merit is graded based on the following criteria:

 * **Obvious MVC/REST architecture**
    * Single-page app style
    * Clearly defined Resources in the app
    * Resource data is persisted by a database
    * Resources have well-factored and isolated M, V, C components
